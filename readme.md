## SEO Audits:

    Technical SEO checks (such as load time, mobile-friendliness, and HTTPS)
    Content analysis (including duplicate content)
    On-page SEO (meta tags, headings, URL structure)

This code includes the following improvements:

    Improved error handling:
        Handle errors gracefully, such as when the website is down or the URL is invalid.
        Implement proper logging and error reporting.

    Performance optimizations:
        Use caching mechanisms to avoid redundant requests.
        Implement lazy loading or pagination for large websites.

    User interface enhancements:
        Display the results in a more visually appealing way, such as using tables or charts.
        Provide options to download the audit results as a file.

    Multi-language support:
        Allow the function to audit websites in different languages.

    Integration with SEO tools and platforms:
        Integrate with SEO tools like Google Analytics or SEMrush to gather additional data.
